# Web Scraping and Data Analysis of Laptops Under Rs. 20,000 💻🔍📊

I'm excited to share a Python project I worked on, which involves web scraping and data analysis of laptops under Rs. 20,000 from Flipkart. 🌐🔎💡

In this project, I utilized the power of web scraping using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to extract information about various laptops, including their product names, prices, ratings, processors, and more. I scraped multiple pages of the Flipkart website to gather a comprehensive dataset. 🕸️📦

After collecting the data, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights and clean the dataset. I handled missing values, converted data types, and extracted additional information such as RAM capacity and brand names from the existing columns. 🧹📝

The analysis included various visualizations to showcase the distribution of laptop brands, RAM types, and processor brands. I identified the top-rated brands and processors based on average ratings and highlighted the most popular laptop models. Additionally, I explored laptops available at the lowest and highest prices within the given budget and analyzed the laptops with the minimum and maximum discount offers. 📈🔍💯

To execute this project, I used popular Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and BeautifulSoup. I also created a custom module called 'Mymodule' to format and display the data in a visually appealing manner. 💻📊🔥

The code and the resulting dataset are available in this repository. Feel free to explore the code, replicate the project, and analyze the dataset further. If you have any questions or feedback, I would be glad to discuss it with you. 🤝📚
